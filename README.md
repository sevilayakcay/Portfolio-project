## 📁 Portfolio Project 

This is my very first webpage and portfolio prototype.
The content may change over time as I continue improving the project, and there are still areas I plan to develop further.

I’m happy with how it’s coming together and I’m very excited for my further edits.
The project was created using HTML and CSS.

Feel free to clone this project and explore my work. I’d love to hear what you think of my skills as a junior developer.
